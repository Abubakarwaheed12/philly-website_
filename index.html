         Can You Have It All?

      <p>Most leaders and innovators are failing because they focus on revenue and<br> strategy alone. Addressing the systems around you is the only real way to<br> activate real change.

         Kelley combines her entrepreneurial success with her therapy skillset and<br> background to offer entrepreneurs the best of both worlds. Using a series of<br> modules, Kelley will help you acknowledge, address, and attack all the<br> negativity in your life to create the balance you and your business not only<br> desperately want, but desperately need.

          <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
          <h3>Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist,<br> Entrepreneur, Venture Studio Partner, Dog<br> Mom</h3>
       
       <p>I am a clinically trained and licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, which sounds like a<br> mouthful, but hear me out. As a trained LMFT, I have been trained to think in systems theory.<br> The idea is that instead of focusing on what’s wrong with an individual, we should actually<br> focus on what’s going with the system around an individual. The work I have done with my<br> clients over the last 7 years while I built several businesses with my partner has brought me<br> to a place where I am wanting to help others in a different way.
       </p>
       <p> As an entrepreneur who is married to an entrepreneur, our lives are surrounded by<br> businesses. I have worked hard on figuring out how I can run 11 companies, be a daughter,<br> friend, partner, and still do the things I love. Most nights, I am tucked in my cozy bed by 10<br> pm and most mornings I am up by 5:30 am ready to start my day. Of course, it is not<br> perfect…but it’s working.

        <h2>How?</h2>
        <p>I have spent the last two years focusing solely on finding balance and I want to share my<br> secrets with you. It is not easy and it requires <b>A LOT</b> of work, but after you work through all<br> of your systemic changes, the end result is incredible.
        </p>
      <p>You can have your life and your company too. Your relationships can be solid. Let's figure<br> out what balance means in your life and start shifting your patterns to get you to where<br> you are able to find the joy, hope, and excitement again.</p>
